###### --1.Configuration Files.1-- ######

##--Basic Management
    Upon initial load, the datapack only enables basic chain mining, auto-lighting and parameter configuration - other features are locked by default;
    Players can use /trigger ATPminer to access the menu in-game, but only admins can access global settings. Choose "Custom" or "Force Enable" in global settings to unlock other features
    Admins will see notifications when players use /trigger menu. To disable: /gamerule sendCommandFeedback false
    This command also disables other command feedback, preventing notification spam from other players' menu usage. Re-enable when command feedback is needed
    Global parameter configuration:
        1.Sub-threads [Maximum blocks processed per tick in each async chain event①, default 64]
            Adjust based on server hardware. Limits chain calculation per tick - higher values mean faster chains (64 means 1280 blocks per second), lower values improve performance (values below 16 may interrupt searches and are not recommended)
            This datapack uses DFS pre-attempt③, automatically switching to async chain④ for large quantities, significantly reducing server crashes from high mspt due to heavy performance consumption
            Note: This is per-event limit. When 2 players chain large quantities simultaneously, thread count doubles. Avoid multiple players doing large-scale chains simultaneously (small chains have minimal impact)
        2.Search limit [Maximum blocks searchable per chain event, default 1048576]
            This is theoretical - practical limits (chain distance, tool durability etc.) usually prevent reaching max (unless intentionally triggered). Adjust as needed (performance-wise, this is secondary)
            Determines maximum blocks that can be searched and mined per chain event. Won't be lower than DFS attempt value
        3.DFS attempt [When search exceeds this block count without completion, switch to async chain (see note 3), default 640]
            Affects when players mine beyond this quantity, using "non-instant" step-by-step search. Below 640 blocks can be processed instantly; above triggers async
            Lower values effectively disable DFS (not recommended unless necessary). Higher values cause brief server lag during large chains; excessively high causes continuous lag until crash
            Note: For player experience, DFS feels bad ("tunnel" mining) when unable to mine all blocks. Even if below 640, async chain (spherical) is used when tool durability or conditions prevent complete mining
        4.Search iterations [Maximum ticks per async chain event, default 32768]
            Determines maximum duration per event (sub-threads × iterations = max limit, e.g. 64×32768). Rarely reaches limit in practice. Adjust as needed (performance-wise, this is secondary)
    Notes:
        ①Async chain event: Visual spreading process, not instant chain mining. Automatically used when search exceeds DFS attempt (BFS-like). Processes partial blocks per tick (sub-thread count) to prevent server crashes
        ②TICK: Minecraft game loop cycle. 1 tick ≈ 0.05s real time. Normally 20 ticks/sec. High server mspt (from heavy calculations like many mobs/players) reduces TPS, causing lag or crashes
        ③DFS pre-attempt: Depth-First Search algorithm ("tunnel" approach) using recursive functions to instantly process large quantities. DFS pre-attempt aborts search when exceeding fixed value (e.g. searching stone - infinite world quantity could crash server)
        ④Async chain: Processes excessive blocks incrementally per tick (BFS chain). "Carpet search" spreads spherically, gradually chaining all blocks. Used when DFS pre-attempt reaches max

##--How to add new chainable blocks (including mod blocks)?>>config
    (Summary: Modify scoreboard, block_matching, mineable_block, reset_score and exp_orb in data/vmn/function/config by following examples.)
    Open data/vmn/function/config to see folders and mcfunction files. Locate 5 mcfunction files (scoreboard, block_matching, mineable_block, reset_score, exp_orb);
    These contain default chainable block lists. Initial lines are comments - add new sections following commented format (format errors make configs ineffective);
    exp_orb is optional - only edit if block drops XP;
    ⚠️Note: To modify custom scoreboard names in scoreboard file, first disable datapack, use /scoreboard to delete old scoreboard, then reload and enable datapack (to prevent naming conflicts).

##--How to disable/uninstall datapack or specific blocks/groups
    Add sections in data/vmn/function/config/uninstall/black_list to temporarily disable block chains;
    Comment out group checks in data/vmn/function/config/combination/scan_group (use #);
    For complete datapack data cleanup, see methods in data/vmn/function/config/uninstall/total_uninstall.

##--How to add blocks to existing chain groups?>>combination
    (Summary: In data/vmn/function/config/combination/score, find target group, add chainable blocks following examples (only scoreboard name varies), then add block IDs to corresponding group file in data/vmn/tags/block/group)
    First ensure block is configured in basic files with associated scoreboard;
    Open data/vmn/function/config/combination/score. If block chains with ore group, open ores file and add new line following format;
    execute if score @s <scoreboard_name> matches 1.. run scoreboard players set #block_value dp_vmn.temp <group_ID>
    Where <scoreboard_name> is mining event name defined in basic config, -2 is ore group ID (-3 for log group);
    Then open data/vmn/tags/block/group/ores, add new block ID following JSON format (strict syntax - don't omit punctuation);
    Block IDs can be found via F3+H, Wiki or mod sites;
    Note: Blocks can't belong to multiple groups - first matched group applies. To remove group members, reverse above steps;
    Note: tags folders exist in both vmn and minecraft paths - pay attention to paths.

##--How to add new chain groups?>>combination
    (Summary: In combination/score, create .mcfunction file with unique ID between -10000~-2, follow existing examples. Create same-name .json in data/vmn/tags/block/group. Add new sections in scan_group and matching_group following examples)
    In data/vmn/function/config/combination/score, create .mcfunction file (e.g. example.mcfunction);
    In data/vmn/tags/block/group, create same-name .json file (e.g. example.json);
    Note: Group names can only contain lowercase a-z, 0-9, _, -, .;
    Add new sections in scan_group and matching_group following examples;
    Note: <group_ID> is customizable integer between -10000~-2, unique across groups. <filename> is above example (no extensions);
    Finally, add blocks to new group following previous tutorial to make it functional.

##--How to add recognizable tools? (For items without tool's max_damage component, e.g. mod tools)
    [For version compatibility, using execute if predicate instead of execute if items] (Note: Path not in config)
    Open data/vmn/function/main/vmn/check_tool2 and check_tool3
    If tool shares durability with vanilla tools, add to existing tags. Example:
    >>>Tool A has 1561 durability. check_tool3 contains:
        execute if predicate vmn:if_items/tool/diamond_tools run scoreboard players set #dfs_max_damage dp_vmn.temp 1561
        Where vmn:if_items/tool/diamond_tools is predicate, 1561 is max durability. Opening vmn/predicate/if_items/tool/diamond_tools shows:
        "mainhand": {"items": "#vmn:tool/diamond_tools"}
        Then vmn/tags/tool/diamond_tools lists vanilla diamond tool IDs - add Tool A's namespace ID here
        Only need to add namespace here - no other file modifications
    If tool doesn't share durability group (e.g. shears at 238 have no such tag group):
    >>>For tools B and C both at 238 durability, two options:
        1.Create new predicates:
            In data/vmn/predicate/if_items/tool, create new .json (e.g. super_tool.json) following examples, changing "items" to tool namespace ID
            E.g. for Tool B with mod namespace abc and ID super_tool: "items":"abc:super_tool"
            In check_tool2 and check_tool3, add lines following format. For check_tool3:
            execute if predicate vmn:if_items/tool/<filename> run scoreboard players set #dfs_max_damage dp_vmn.temp <max_durability>
            Following example: <filename> becomes super_tool, <max_durability> becomes 238. Similarly modify check_tool2;
            Repeat for Tool C;
            Finally, add "abc:super_tool" to data/vmn/tags/item/damage_tool.
        2.Create new tool tag:
            In data/vmn/tags/item/tool, create new .json (e.g. all_tools.json), add all tools sharing max durability following format;
            Following method 1, create predicate with "items":"#vmn:tool/all_tools"
            Add lines to check_tool2 and check_tool3 following format (see method 1);
            (If group durability is 238, you could add shears here)
            Finally, add "#vmn:tool/all_tools" to data/vmn/tags/item/damage_tool.

##--How to add new "no durability cost" blocks? (e.g. flowers/grass, only affects shears)
    Add blocks to data/vmn/tags/block/no_damage following format.

##--What are other datapack files for? Can they be modified?
    data folder contains all data. Some configs can be modified simply. Core parts not recommended for general users to modify to avoid issues;
    1.data/minecraft/tags/function/load and tick are initialization and game loop function tags (core);
    2.data/vmn/advancement, item_modifier, loot_table contain condition checks, probability simulations and loot drops (core);
    3.data/vmn/tags contains tag files for operating/matching element groups. function folder contains function tags (core);
    4.data/vmn/tags/block and item are configurable:
        group contains chain group tags (covered above) - can add new groups/members;
        check_dirts.json checks soils for auto-replanting saplings (default vanilla dirt);
        farm_dirt.json checks farmable soils;
        no_damage covered above;
        Three torch files are for auto-lighting block checks;
    5.data/vmn/tags/item configurable:
        tool contains tool groups for max durability (covered above);
        farm/farm_tools.json contains farming tools;
        valid_seeds.json contains range-plantable seeds;
        damage_tool.json lists all recognized tools for durability checks;
        whitelist_tool.json lists durability-exempt items (armor, special tools etc.);
    6.data/vmn/predicate contains condition check predicates:
        location checks positions;
        if_block/torch files check auto-lighting blocks;
        if_items/damage_tool.json and whitelist_tool.json check corresponding tags;
        if_items/offhand_water_bucket.json checks offhand water buckets;
        if_items/tool checks tool tags (covered above);
    7.data/vmn/function contains execution code - datapack's core:
        main contains critical code - not recommended to modify without understanding function calls;
        config is customizable:
            farmland contains crop range planting configs - modify following examples to add new plantable seeds;
            smart_replant contains smart replanting - farmland for crops, other files for saplings;
            vanilla contains vanilla block essentials - usually no modification needed;
            Add/modify features by editing all related configs following rules and examples.
    8.Supplemental tag format notes:
        Tags use format like {"id":"minecraft:mangrove_log","required":false} (whitespace omitted) for mod removal compatibility;
        Example shows 1.19 mangrove log. "required":false ensures tag remains valid in pre-1.19 versions (ignores this ID).

###### --2.Compatibility & Issues.2-- ######

##--Compatibility:
    1.Datapack commands bypass land protection plugins - incompatible with land claims;
    2.Some plugins/mods alter vanilla command logic - disable them or this datapack if issues arise;
    3.Few server cores (e.g. Folia) don't support datapacks. Most plugin/mod/vanilla servers do;
    4.[With certain mods] rare damage tag misapplication may prevent item stacking (can be deliberately triggered);
    5.Reload may show "Failed to load" errors in some versions - normal for version compatibility (different versions ignore incompatible formats). If server disables features due to errors, disable datapack (report severe cases);

##--Possible Questions:
    1.Player: Why aren't some features working?
      First check if globally enabled, then check for conflicts with other enabled features;
    2.Player: Why does chain mining stop after small area?
      Common in large chains - usually from held item changes. Stackable items changing count ends chains early (solution: hold unrelated items, full stacks, or non-stackable tools);
    3.What are the □ symbols in settings?
      Actually fire🔥 and lock🔒🔓 icons. Low versions (e.g. 1.18) without forced Unicode fonts don't display them. Generally: red□=locked, green□=unlocked;
    4.Player: Why no glass chains? Why some blocks chain but others don't?
      Glass theoretically can chain (has glass and pane groups) but may lack valid mining tools. Common blocks require hotkey (README.md lists default non-hotkey blocks);

##--Beta Bugs:
    1."Unbreakable" hoes can't range-farm;
    2."Rectangle mining" mode may consume regular tool durability for flower/grass groups;
